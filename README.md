SGS Datta Deepam Flash Card Application
---------------------------------------

*Svadhyaya* is a Sanskrit term for spiritual study. Its deep meaning is
self-study, ultimimately leading to knowledge of the devine through union
with Divinity itself. More commonly Svadhyaya means study of scripture:
spiritually uplifting reading and reflection.

[SGS Datta Deepam](http://www.sgsdattadeepam.org) is devoted to Svadhyaya
of Vedic Dharma: "SGS Datta Deepam is an online gurukulam envisioned by His
Holiness Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji which unravels the boundless
wisdom and truth in our Scriptures and brings to light the glory of
Sanatana Dharma."

This "flashcard" app is designed to supports this site with an expandiing
range of flashcard "decks" (quetion databases), and is suitable for a wide
range of study through user-created flashcard decks.

To avoid Datta Deepam specific formating, remove first statement in app.js
.run call.

This app is in an early stage of development, with much remaining to do. See the
