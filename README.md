SGS Datta Deepam Flash Card Application
---------------------------------------

*Svadhyaya* is a Sanskrit term for spiritual study. Its deep meaning is
self-study, ultimimately leading to knowledge of the devine through union
with Divinity itself. More commonly Svadhyaya means study of scripture:
spiritually uplifting reading and reflection.

[SGS Datta Deepam](http://www.sgsdattadeepam.org) is devoted to Svadhyaya
of Vedic Dharma: "SGS Datta Deepam is an online gurukulam envisioned by His
Holiness Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji which unravels the boundless
wisdom and truth in our Scriptures and brings to light the glory of
Sanatana Dharma."

This "flashcard" app is designed to supports this site with an expandiing
range of flashcard "decks" (quetion databases). It is also suitable for a wide
range of study through user-created flashcard decks.

To avoid Datta Deepam specific formating, remove `$rootScope.dattaDeepam` statement in **app.js** `.run` call.

This app is early in development.
