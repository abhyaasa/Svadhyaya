## SGS Datta Deepam Flash Card Application

*Svadhyaya* is a Sanskrit term for spiritual study. Its deep meaning is self-study, ultimately leading to knowledge of the divine through union with Divinity itself. More commonly Svadhyaya means study of scripture (spiritually uplifting reading) and self  reflection.

[SGS Datta Deepam](http://www.sgsdattadeepam.org) is devoted to Svadhyaya of Vedic Dharma: "SGS Datta Deepam is an online gurukulam envisioned by HisHoliness Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji which unravels the boundless wisdom and truth in our Scriptures and brings to light the glory of Sanatana Dharma."

This "flashcard" app is designed to supports this site with an expanded range of flashcard "decks" (quetion databases). It is also suitable for a wide range of study through user-created flashcard decks.
