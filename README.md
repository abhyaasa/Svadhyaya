## SGS Datta Deepam Flash Card Application

*Svadhyaya* is a Sanskrit term for spiritual study. Its deep meaning is self-study, ultimately leading to knowledge of the divine through union with Divinity itself. More commonly Svadhyaya means study of scripture (spiritually uplifting reading) and self  reflection.

[SGS Datta Deepam](http://www.sgsdattadeepam.org) is devoted to Svadhyaya of Vedic Dharma: "SGS Datta Deepam is an online gurukulam envisioned by HisHoliness Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji which unravels the boundless wisdom and truth in our Scriptures and brings to light the glory of Sanatana Dharma."

This "flashcard" app is designed to supports this site with an expanded range of flashcard "decks" (quetion databases). It is also suitable for a wide range of study through user-created flashcard decks.

A partial list of supported features:

- A wide range of question types, including multiple choice, multiple answer, true/false, short answer, and matching. Question text may be plain unicode or html, including images.

- Question database entry in json or a compact custom format. The latter supports a number of options, including markdown text formatting, sequence questions (in which the answer is the next question), and tag ranges.

- User choice of Devanagari or several Roman alphabet transliteration schemes for display of Sanscrit text.

- User selection of flash card decks from a library.

- Skipping of cards or their removal from the deck.
