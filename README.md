SGS Datta Deepam Flash Card Application
---------------------------------------

*Svadhyaya* is a Sanskrit term for spiritual study. Its deep meaning is
self-study, ultimimately leading to knowledge of the devine through union
with Divinity itself. More commonly Svadhyaya means study of scripture:
spiritually uplifting reading and reflection.

[SGS Datta Deepam](http://www.sgsdattadeepam.org) is devoted to Svadhyaya
of Vedic Dharma: "SGS Datta Deepam is an online gurukulam envisioned by His
Holiness Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji which unravels the boundless
wisdom and truth in our Scriptures and brings to light the glory of
Sanatana Dharma."

This "flashcard" app is designed to supports this site with an expandiing
range of flashcard "decks" (quetion databases). It is also suitable for a wide
range of study through user-created flashcard decks.


### Customization

To avoid Datta Deepam specific formating, define a `flavor` other than `dattaDeepam` in **www/data/config.json**.

Python 2.6+ (maybe earlier) is needed to run **tools/*.py** scripts. Use `-h`
argument for usage information. `cdeck.py --format_help` provides documentation
on deck and compact deck file formats.


### Development and support

This app is early in development.
See `www/todo.md` and (github issues)[https://github.com/vasudeva-chaynes/Svadhyaya/issues].

Feel free to submit a github issue or wiki contribution,
or email <svadhyaya.app@gmail.com> for support or comment.
